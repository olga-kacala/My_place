In this playground, I have created some **old school games** using **React App**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**. 

Everything is wrapped in the **landing page**, where you can find all the **important links**. 

The **memory game** was made with a **picture created with the help of AI** and with the permission of my dog, **Pola** üê∂. 

So, just **sit back, relax, and enjoy!**
